Development of NPK Sensing kit and Fertilizer Dispensing Robot

Abstract:

Measurement of N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorus) and K (Potassium) contents of soil is necessary to decide how much extra contents of these nutrients are to be added in the soil to increase crop fertility. This improves the quality of the soil which in turn yields a good quality crop. But there is no real time sensor that detects the contents of Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium in the soil. This project work is based on developing the sensor which is based on the use of color sensor. The color sensor uses the colorimetric principle. The color sensor is based on the principle of absorption of color by solution.The N, P, and K amounts in the sample are determined by comparing the sensor output i.e., the R,G,B values to a color chart. It helps in determining the N, P, K amounts as high, medium, low.  It is useful in dispensing only required amount of fertilizers in the soil. This dispensing of fertilizer is carried out by a track following robot.

The project work has been divided into three main sections:
1. Development of a sensor system for estimation of nutrients present in the soil.
2. Development of an intelligent system for the control of flow of required amount of fertilizers.
3. Dispensing of fertilizer on the field with the help of an automated track following robot.
